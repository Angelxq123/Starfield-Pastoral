## Immersive Portals Mod for NeoForge

The town doorway renderer adapts the stencil/depth render sequence, nested world context, front clipping,
Sodium view-context handling, and pre-camera traversal sequence from Immersive Portals Mod for NeoForge.

The adapted implementation was changed into one fixed, same-level town doorway. It removes Immersive Portals'
portal entity, registries, multi-dimension loader, configuration API, and all compile/runtime dependencies on that mod.
